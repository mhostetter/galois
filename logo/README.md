# Logo

The symbol in the logo has two references. The first is to NumPy's logo and its 3-D array, symbolic of the library's main
function of array processing. The second is to a Rubik's cube, which is a canonical example of a mathematical group. Groups
were first discovered and coined by Evariste Galois in the 1830s.
