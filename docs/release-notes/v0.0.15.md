# v0.0.15

*Released May 12, 2021*

## Breaking Changes

- Rename `poly_exp_mod()` to `poly_pow()` to mimic the native `pow()` function.
- Rename `fermat_primality_test()` to `is_prime_fermat()`.
- Rename `miller_rabin_primality_test()` to `is_prime_miller_rabin()`.

## Changes

- Massive linear algebra speed-ups. (See #88)
- Massive polynomial speed-ups. (See #88)
- Various Galois field performance enhancements. (See #92)
- Support  `np.convolve()` for two Galois field arrays.
- Allow polynomial arithmetic with Galois field scalars (of the same field). (See #99), e.g.

```python
>>> GF = galois.GF(3)

>>> p = galois.Poly([1,2,0], field=GF)
Poly(x^2 + 2x, GF(3))

>>> p * GF(2)
Poly(2x^2 + x, GF(3))
```

- Allow creation of 0-degree polynomials from integers. (See #99), e.g.

```python
>>> p = galois.Poly(1)
Poly(1, GF(2))
```

- Add the four Oakley fields from RFC 2409.
- Speed-up unit tests.
- Restructure API reference.
