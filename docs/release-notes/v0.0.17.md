# v0.0.17

*Released June 15, 2021*

## Breaking Changes

- Rename `FieldMeta` to `FieldClass`.
- Remove `target` keyword from `FieldClass.compile()` until there is better support for GPUs.
- Consolidate `verify_irreducible` and `verify_primitive` keyword arguments into `verify` for the `galois.GF()` class factory function.
- Remove group arrays until there is more complete support.

## Changes

- Speed-up Galois field class creation time.
- Speed-up JIT compilation time by caching functions.
- Speed-up `Poly.roots()` by JIT compiling it.
- Add BCH codes with `galois.BCH`.
- Add ability to generate irreducible polynomials with `irreducible_poly()` and `irreducible_polys()`.
- Add ability to generate primitive polynomials with `primitive_poly()` and `primitive_polys()`.
- Add computation of the minimal polynomial of an element of an extension field with `minimal_poly()`.
- Add display of arithmetic tables with `FieldClass.arithmetic_table()`.
- Add display of field element representation table with `FieldClass.repr_table()`.
- Add Berlekamp-Massey algorithm in `berlekamp_massey()`.
- Enable ipython tab-completion of Galois field classes.
- Cleanup API reference page.
- Add introduction to Galois fields tutorials.
- Fix bug in `is_primitive()` where some reducible polynomials were marked irreducible.
- Fix bug in integer<-->polynomial conversions for large binary polynomials.
- Fix bug in "power" display mode of 0.
- Other minor bug fixes.
