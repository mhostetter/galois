# v0.0.27

*Released April 22, 2022*

## Breaking Changes

- Sunsetted support for Python 3.6. This was necessary to support forward references with `from __future__ import annotations` (available in
  Python 3.7+). That import is required to support the type aliases in the new `galois.typing` subpackage. ([#339](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/339))
- Removed the `FieldClass` metaclass from the public API. It was previously included due to an inability of Sphinx to document class
  properties. In this release, we monkey patched Sphinx to document all classmethods, class properties, and instance methods
  in `FieldArray` itself. ([#343](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/343))
  - Use `issubclass(GF, galois.FieldArray)` anywhere `isinstance(GF, galois.FieldClass)` was previously used.
  - Annotate with `Type[galois.FieldArray]` anywhere `galois.FieldClass` was previously used.

## Changes

- Added the `galois.typing` subpackage, similar to `np.typing`. It contains type hints for common coercible data types used
  throughout the library, including `ElementLike`, `ArrayLike`, and `PolyLike`. With these type hints, the annotations are simpler and
  more clear. ([#339](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/339))
- Modified functions to accept coercible data types wherever possible. For example, functions now accept `PolyLike` objects instead
  of strictly `Poly` instances. ([#339](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/339))
- Added `Array` which is an abstract base class of `FieldArray` (and `RingArray` in a future release). ([#336](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/336))
- Added support for the DFT over any finite field using `np.fft.fft()` and `np.fft.ifft()`. ([#335](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/335))
    ```python
    >>> x
    GF([127, 191,  69,  35, 221, 242, 193, 108,  72, 102,  80, 163,  13,  74,
        218, 159, 207,  12, 159, 129,  92,  71], order=3^5)
    >>> X = np.fft.fft(x); X
    GF([ 16,  17,  20, 137,  58, 166, 178,  52,  19, 109, 115,  93,  99, 214,
        187, 235, 195,  96, 232,  45, 241,  24], order=3^5)
    >>> np.fft.ifft(X)
    GF([127, 191,  69,  35, 221, 242, 193, 108,  72, 102,  80, 163,  13,  74,
        218, 159, 207,  12, 159, 129,  92,  71], order=3^5)
    ```
- Implemented the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 `O(N*log(N))` algorithm for the NTT and JIT compiled it. ([#333](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/333))
    ```ipython
    In [2]: x = list(range(1, 1024 + 1))

    # v0.0.26
    In [4]: %timeit X = galois.ntt(x)
    5.2 ms ± 121 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)

    # v0.0.27
    In [4]: %timeit X = galois.ntt(x)
    695 µs ± 4.56 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
    ```
- Added the `FieldArray.primitive_root_of_unity()` classmethod. ([#333](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/333))
    ```python
    >>> GF = galois.GF(3**5)
    >>> GF.primitive_root_of_unity(22)
    GF(39, order=3^5)
    ```
- Added the `FieldArray.primitive_roots_of_unity()` classmethod. ([#333](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/333))
    ```python
    >>> GF = galois.GF(3**5)
    >>> GF.primitive_roots_of_unity(22)
    GF([ 14,  39,  44,  59, 109, 114, 136, 200, 206, 226], order=3^5)
    ```
- Made 0-th degree coefficients more differentiated when using the polynomial element representation. ([#328](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/issues/328))
    ```python
    # v0.0.26
    >>> print(f)
    (α^2 + α + 1)x^4 + (α^3)x + α^3 + 2α^2 + 2α + 2
    # v0.0.27
    >>> print(f)
    (α^2 + α + 1)x^4 + (α^3)x + (α^3 + 2α^2 + 2α + 2)
    ```
- Restructured code base for clarity. ([#336](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/336))
- Fixed display of overloaded functions in API reference. ([#337](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/issues/337))
- Fixed broken "References" sections in API reference. ([#281](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/issues/281))
- Fixed other small bugs.
