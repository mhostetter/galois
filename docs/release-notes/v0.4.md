# v0.4

## v0.4.0

*Released July 2, 2024*

### Changes

- Added support for NumPy 2.0. ([#550](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/550))
- Added support for Numba 0.60. ([#550](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/550))

## v0.4.1

*Released July 6, 2024*

### Changes

- Fixed multithreading incompatibility. Previously only one thread could read from the SQLite databases. ([#558](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/558))
- Clarified `Poly` string representation when underlying field is non-primitive and uses the `"poly"` element representation. ([#329](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/issues/329))
- Fixed typo in error message. ([#557](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/557))
- Made minor documentation improvements.

## v0.4.2

*Released September 5, 2024*

### Changes

- Added support for NumPy 2.1. ([#567](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/issues/567))
  - *Correction:* NumPy 2.1 is still unsupported because Numba 0.60 doesn't include support.

## v0.4.4

*Released January 21, 2025*

### Changes

- Added support for Python 3.13. ([#587](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/587))
- Added support for NumPy 2.1. ([#587](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/587))

## v0.4.5

*Released April 13, 2025*

### Changes

- Improved performance of linear algebra over finite fields with prime order. This is achieved by using floating-point
  BLAS implementations, where possible. A 10-100x performance improvement is seen. ([#596](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/596))
- Upgraded documentation styling.

## v0.4.6

*Released April 30, 2025*

### Changes

- Improved performance further of linear algebra over finite fields with prime order. ([#598](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/598))
- Improved `TypeError` description for arithmetic on `FieldArray` instances with same order but different irreducible polynomials. ([#602](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/602))
- Fixed bug in `.log()` of scalar 0-dim `FieldArray`s. ([#600](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/600))
- Fixed bug in typing of `IterableLike`, which didn't support lists of `NDArray`. ([#602](https://github.com/mhostetter/galois/pull/602))
