Unit Tests
==========

The :obj:`galois` library uses `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/>`_ for unit testing.

Install
-------

First, `pytest` needs to be installed on your system. Easily install it by installing the development dependencies.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Configuration
-------------

The `pytest` configuration is stored in `pyproject.toml`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../pyproject.toml
   :caption: pyproject.toml
   :start-at: [tool.pytest.ini_options]
   :end-before: [tool.coverage.report]
   :language: toml

Run from the command line
-------------------------

Execute all of the unit tests manually from the command line.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pytest tests/

Or only run a specific test file.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pytest tests/test_math.py

Or only run a specific unit test.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pytest tests/test_math.py::test_gcd

Run from VS Code
----------------

Included is a VS Code configuration file `.vscode/settings.json`. This instructs VS Code about how to invoke `pytest`.
VS Code's integrated test infrastructure will locate the tests and allow you to run or debug any test.

Test vectors
------------

Test vectors are generated by third-party tools and stored in `.pkl` files. Most test vectors are stored in these folders:

- `tests/data/`
- `tests/fields/data/GF(*)/`
- `tests/polys/data/GF(*)/`

The scripts that generate the test vectors are:

- `scripts/generate_int_test_vectors.py`
- `scripts/generate_field_test_vectors.py`

The two primary third-party tools are `Sage <https://www.sagemath.org/>`_ and `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_.

Install Sage
............

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install sagemath

Install SymPy
.............

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install sympy

Generate test vectors
.....................

To re-generate the test vectors locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 scripts/generate_int_test_vectors.py
    $ python3 scripts/generate_field_test_vectors.py

The scripts use random number generator seeds to generate reproducible test vectors. To generate *different*
test vectors, modify the seeds. It's also easy to increase the number of test cases for any individual test.
