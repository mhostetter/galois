# Acknowledgements

- This library is an extension of, and completely dependent on, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
- We heavily rely on [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and its just-in-time compiler for optimizing performance of Galois field arithmetic.
- We use Frank Luebeck's compilation of [Conway polynomials](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/data/ConwayPol/index.html).
- We also use Wolfram's compilation of [primitive polynomials](https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/Primitive-Polynomials/).
- We extensively use [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) for generating test vectors.
- We also use [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) for generating test vectors.

Many thanks!
