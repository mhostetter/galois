# Versioning

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases are versioned `major.minor.patch`. Major releases introduce API-changing
features. Minor releases add features and are backwards compatible with other releases in `major.x.x`. Patch releases fix bugs in a minor release
and are backwards compatible with other releases in `major.minor.x`.

Releases before `1.0.0` are alpha and beta releases. Alpha releases are `0.0.alpha`. There is no API compatibility guarantee for them. They can
be thought of as `0.0.alpha-major`. Beta releases are `0.beta.x` and are API compatible. They can be thought of as `0.beta-major.beta-minor`.
