Installation
============

Install with pip
----------------

The latest version of :obj:`galois` can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/galois/>`_ using `pip`.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python3 - m pip install galois

.. note::

   Fun fact: read `here <https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/>`_ from python core developer `Brett Cannon <https://twitter.com/brettsky>`_ about why it's better
   to install using `python3 -m pip` rather than `pip3`.
