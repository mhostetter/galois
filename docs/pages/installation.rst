Installation
============

Install with pip
----------------

The latest version of :obj:`galois` can be installed from PyPI via `pip`.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python3 - m pip install galois

Fun fact: read `here <https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/>`_ from python core dev `Brett Cannon <https://twitter.com/brettsky>`_ about why it's better
to install with `python3 -m pip` rather than `pip3`.
